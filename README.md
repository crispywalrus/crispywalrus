Currently I'm kind of wasting my time working for a big enterprise development shop. There's very little of interest being done, and what is of interest is generally being done in a most peculiar way. I'm not good with the long, slow marches to release where everyone gets to spend hours in meeting listening to what is mostly political talk. I'm really a startup kind of guy but the startup world has morphed away from the small band doing something new and interesting to big teams with big money backing up front disrupting last weeks disruption or just plain scamming. I don't know anything about machine learning, I'm still not interested in crypto-currencies but I'd love to get out of the way of the stumbling giant I'm currently providing services to.
